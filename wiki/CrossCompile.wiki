#summary How to cross-compile Gray Matter on Linux to run on Windows

= Prepare =

You need Subversion (to obtain the Gray Matter source code) and MinGW (to cross-compile Gray Matter for Windows).  If you don't already have these tools, install them now:

=== On Ubuntu ===
  * To install Subversion, type: *sudo apt-get install subversion*
  * To install MinGW, type: *sudo apt-get install mingw32*

=== On Gentoo ===
  * To install Subversion, type: *emerge subversion*
  * To install MinGW, [http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_MinGW follow these steps] up to and including: *crossdev mingw32*  For the impatient, type:
    * *emerge -va sys-devel/crossdev*
    * *echo 'PORTDIR_OVERLAY="/usr/local/overlays/crossdev"' >> /etc/make.conf*
    * *crossdev mingw32*

= Obtain =

If you don't already have it, install Subversion.  Then, type: *svn checkout http://gray-matter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gray-matter*  Congratulations!  The Gray Matter source code is in the newly created *gray-matter/* directory.

= Cross-Compile =

On Linux, it's easy to use MinGW to cross-compile a Windows executable.  If you don't already have it, install MinGW.  Then, in the *gray-matter/* directory, type: *make -f WINmakefile*  Congratulations!  Your shiny, happy Windows executable is: *bin/gray.exe*

= Install =

= Run =

*!WinBoard*: !WinBoard is a nice frontend for chess engines on Windows.  You can download it from the XBoard website: [http://www.tim-mann.org/xboard.html]

*Install*: Unpack and place the gray.exe file wherever !WinBoard is installed.

Start !WinBoard via *!WinBoard Startup Dialog*, and, in the first box, replace ~~GNUChess~~ with *gray.exe*.  The game should start, and the engine defaults to playing black.  Use the menus to change this.
