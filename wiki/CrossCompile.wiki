#summary How to cross-compile Gray Matter on Linux to run on Windows

= Prepare =

You need Subversion (to obtain the Gray Matter source code) and MinGW (to cross-compile Gray Matter for Windows).  If you don't already have these tools, install them now:

=== On Gentoo ===
  * To install Subversion, type: *{{{emerge subversion}}}*
  * To install MinGW, [http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_MinGW follow these steps] up to and including: *{{{crossdev mingw32}}}*  For the impatient, type:
    * *{{{emerge -va sys-devel/crossdev}}}*
    * *{{{echo 'PORTDIR_OVERLAY="/usr/local/overlays/crossdev"' >> /etc/make.conf}}}*
    * *{{{crossdev mingw32}}}*
=== On Ubuntu ===
  * To install Subversion, type: *{{{sudo apt-get install subversion}}}*
  * To install MinGW, type: *{{{sudo apt-get install mingw32}}}*

= Obtain =

To download the latest Gray Matter source code, type: *{{{svn checkout http://gray-matter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gray-matter}}}*  The source code now resides in the *{{{gray-matter/}}}* directory.

= Cross-Compile =

To cross-compile Gray Matter for Windows, in the *{{{gray-matter/}}}* directory, type: *{{{make -f WINmakefile}}}*  The Windows executable is now: *{{{bin/gray.exe}}}*

= Install =

= Run =

*!WinBoard*: !WinBoard is a nice frontend for chess engines on Windows.  You can download it from the XBoard website: [http://www.tim-mann.org/xboard.html]

*Install*: Unpack and place the gray.exe file wherever !WinBoard is installed.

Start !WinBoard via *{{{WinBoard Startup Dialog}}}*, and, in the first box, replace ~~*{{{GNUChess}}}*~~ with *{{{gray.exe}}}*.  The game should start, and the engine defaults to playing black.  Use the menus to change this.
