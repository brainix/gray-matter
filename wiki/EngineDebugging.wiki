#summary Gray Matter can generate files in XML format to ease the debugging of
search algorithms and / or evaluation functions.

= Introduction =

The perft() function can be used to test the move generator. If exactly the number
of moves is generated as is done by other engines, from several different test
positions, it is quite likely the implementation is correct.

To have similar and general functionality for the search and evaluation algorithms,
we decided to dump data into XML files.
This makes it possible to manually inspect all positions that Gray Matter examined
(some positions might be pruned).
External tools can be developed to compare for different chess engines.
These tools could, for example, find the greatest differences in evaluations, so the
programmer could concentrate on these first.
