#summary Gray Matter can generate a search and evaluation dump in PGN format to ease the debugging of search algorithms and / or evaluation functions.

= Introduction =

The [perft] function can be used to test the move generator. If exactly the number
of moves is generated as is done by other engines, from several different test
positions, it is quite likely the implementation is correct.

To have similar and general functionality for the search and evaluation algorithms,
we decided to dump data into PGN files using recursive annotated variations (RAV), which are just game variations between parentheses.
This makes it possible to manually inspect all positions that Gray Matter examined
(some positions might be pruned).
External tools can be used (or developed) to compare for different chess engines.
These tools could, for example, find the greatest differences in evaluations, so the
programmer could concentrate on these first.
