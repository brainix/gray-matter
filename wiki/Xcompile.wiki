This document only explains how to cross-compile Gray Matter on Linux to run on Windows.  If you're interested in compiling _and_ running it on Linux, [Compile click here].  If you're interested in using a pre-built executable on Windows, [Install click here].

Carry out the *Prepare* and *Download and Cross-Compile* steps on Linux and the *Install and Run* step on Windows.

= Prepare =

You need Subversion and MinGW.  If you don't already have these tools, install them now:

=== On Gentoo ===
  * To install Subversion, type: *{{{emerge subversion}}}*
  * To install MinGW, [http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_MinGW follow these steps] up to and including: *{{{crossdev mingw32}}}*  For the impatient, type:
    * *{{{emerge -va sys-devel/crossdev}}}*
    * *{{{echo 'PORTDIR_OVERLAY="/usr/local/overlays/crossdev"' >> /etc/make.conf}}}*
    * *{{{crossdev mingw32}}}*
=== On Ubuntu ===
  * To install Subversion, type: *{{{sudo apt-get install subversion}}}*
  * To install MinGW, type: *{{{sudo apt-get install mingw32}}}*

= Download and Cross-Compile =

Type:
  * *{{{svn checkout http://gray-matter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gray-matter/}}}*
  * *{{{cd gray-matter/}}}*
  * *{{{gmake -f WINmakefile}}}*

The Windows executable is now: *{{{bin/gray.exe}}}*

= Install and Run =

  * On Windows, [Install follow these steps].  Of course, instead of the provided *{{{gray.exe}}}*, use the one you just compiled.
