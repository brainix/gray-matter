#summary Mission statement.
[http://gray-matter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/credits The Gray Matter Team]'s mission is to develop a competitive, pedagogical chess engine.  And, most importantly, to have [http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2005/10/ofun.html fun] while doing it!

=== Short Term Goals (for the Next Month) ===
  * to nurture an active community of hackers and chess players by
    * cleaning up and commenting code, authoring documentation
    * automating [http://tim-mann.org/ics.html ICS] play
    * setting up a dedicated testing box to run on [http://www.freechess.org/ FICS] 24/7
    * making friends in person, on IRC, and on ICS
  * to generate/accept all legal moves (including en passant!) and correctly detect checkmate, stalemate
  * to adopt a version numbering standard and provide builds
  * to earn a provisional rating
=== Mid Term Goals (for the Next Year) ===
  * to nurture an active community of hackers and chess players
  * to clean up algorithms and data structures to be more robust
  * to prove (or at least provide evidence for) correctness of search (equivalence to straight [http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/minimax.html MiniMax])
  * for the engine to regularly checkmate its hackers
=== Long Term Goals (for the Project's Lifetime) ===
  * to nurture an active community of hackers and chess players
  * to employ state-of-the-art techniques like
