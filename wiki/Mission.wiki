    * Automating [http://tim-mann.org/ics.html ICS] play,
    * Setting up a dedicated testing box to run on [http://www.freechess.org/ FICS] 24/7, and
    * Making friends.
  * ~~To generate/accept all/only legal moves (including en passant and castling!) and correctly detect checkmate/stalemate.~~
  * To adopt a version numbering standard and provide builds.
  * To earn a provisional rating.

=== Mid Term Goals (for the Next Year) ===
  * To nurture a community of hackers and chess players.
