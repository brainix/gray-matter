#summary How to compile and run Gray Matter on Windows

= Introduction =

Explains how to compile and run Gray Matter for MS Windows.

= Compilation =

*cross-compilation*: It is extremely easy to build a win32 executable using MinGW's compiler utilities on a UNIX-like system.  First, you have to get MinGW installed for your system, then it's as simple as 'make -f WINmakefile' in gray-matter's root dir.

*Gentoo Linux*: Follow the steps up to and including 'crossdev mingw32': [http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_MinGW]

= Running =

*WinBoard*: WinBoard is a nice frontend for chess engines on Windows.  You can download it from the XBoard website: [http://www.tim-mann.org/xboard.html]

*Install*: Unpack and place the gray.exe file wherever WinBoard is installed.

*Run*: Start WinBoard via "WinBoard Startup Dialog", and enter "gray.exe" in the first box instead of "GNUChess".  The game should start, and the engine defaults to playing black.  Use the menus to change this.
