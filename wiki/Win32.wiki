#summary Epic headache: porting to Windows.

= Introduction =

I've given up on using MinGW to cross-compile from Linux to Win32.  This is mainly because MinGW doesn't support Pthreads.  "Luckily," there's an [http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/ open source Pthreads implementation for Win32].  I've successfully used it with Dev-C++ on a Win32 box to resolve that issue.  Now for the nasty:

= Details =

~~*uint64_t*~~:  Win32 doesn't include this type by default, so we need an #ifdef in [http://gray-matter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/inc/types.h types.h], if uint64_t isn't defined, to #include <stdint.h>.

*Update*:  In [http://gray-matter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/inc/gray.h gray.h], we've just included stdint.h.  Most likely, it's implicitly included on Linux, and that's why that type is defined there, so explicitly including it shouldn't hurt anything.

~~*class search*~~:  There's a not-so-obvious recursive dependency problem with respect to 'class search' and 'class xboard' - each depends on the other's declaration.  I started with a simple forward declaration of 'class search' in [http://gray-matter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/inc/xboard.h xboard.h], but that didn't resolve the issue.  Then, instead of including everything in [http://gray-matter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/inc/gray.h gray.h], I completely re-hauled the include system to be more "parallel," and this actually worked.  Before you get the tar and feathers, I decided I'd changed too much, so I'm back with the original layout and dependency problem.  Why on earth this isn't an issue on Linux is beyond me.  We may need to put all the classes in a 'namespace gray', because these generic class names may be causing this problem; 'class search' isn't exactly unique.

*Update*:  We've gone with Doug's include overhaul but abandoned the namespace idea.  It seems to work beautifully.  Oh, we've also tarred and feathered Doug.

~~*ffsll()*~~:  Win32 doesn't come with this function (needed all through the board class).

*Update*:  We've yoinked GNU's ffsll() and ffsl() and put them in the board class.

~~*search.h*~~:  Win32 insists on using the system's search.h instead of Gray Matter's.

*Update*:  We've resolved the problem by including "inc/search.h" and passing the compiler -I..

*SIGALRM* and *setitimer()*:  Steve Ballmer was too busy throwing chairs to implement this signal and function.  According to this Microsoft [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/interopMigration/taskstools/migrate/unix/ucamg/ch05uav3.mspx document], we're supposed to use !SetTimer()?  Fantastic work, Redmond monkeys.  It would've been easier to make Windows POSIX conformant than to author this document.
