#summary How to compile on Cygwin on Windows.
#labels Phase-Deploy

=Install Cygwin=
  * Download Cygwin's {{{setup.exe}}} from one of the mirrors at: http://www.cygwin.com/mirrors.html
  * Run {{{setup.exe}}} and make sure to install the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and G++.

=Compile Gray Matter=
  * Type: *{{{make -f CYGmakefile}}}*

=Install WinBoard=

=Hack WinBoard=
  * !WinBoard also uses Cygwin.  It's distributed with a file named {{{cygwin1.dll}}}, which is likely out of date with the version we just compiled Gray Matter against.  Copy the {{{cygwin1.dll}}} file from Cygwin's {{{bin\}}} folder into !WinBoard's folder.
