#summary How to compile in Cygwin on Windows.
#labels Phase-Deploy

This document only explains how to compile Gray Matter within the Cygwin environment on Windows.  If you're interested in compiling and running it on Linux, [Compile click here].  If you're interested in using a pre-built executable on Windows, [Install click here].

=Install Cygwin=
  * Download Cygwin's *{{{setup.exe}}}* from one of the [http://www.cygwin.com/mirrors.html mirrors].
  * Run *{{{setup.exe}}}* and be sure to install the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and G++.

=Compile Gray Matter=
  * Use your favorite [http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html#clients Subversion client] to check out the latest Gray Matter source code from: *{{{http://gray-matter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/}}}*
  * In Cygwin, *{{{cd}}}* into the *{{{gray-matter/}}}* directory, and
  * Type: *{{{make -f CYGmakefile}}}*
The Windows executable is now: *{{{bin/gray.exe}}}*

=Install WinBoard and Gray Matter=
  * [Install Follow these steps.]  Of course, instead of the provided *{{{gray.exe}}}*, use the one you just compiled.

=Hack WinBoard=
  * !WinBoard also uses Cygwin.  It's distributed with a file named *{{{cygwin1.dll}}}* which is out of date with the version we just compiled Gray Matter against.  Copy the *{{{cygwin1.dll}}}* from Cygwin's *{{{bin/}}}* directory into !WinBoard's directory.
