#summary How to compile in Cygwin on Windows.
#labels Phase-Deploy

=Install Cygwin=
  * Download Cygwin's *{{{setup.exe}}}* from one of the [http://www.cygwin.com/mirrors.html mirrors].
  * Run *{{{setup.exe}}}* and make sure to install the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and G++.

=Compile Gray Matter=
  * Use your favorite Subversion client to check out the latest Gray Matter source code.
  * In Cygwin, *{{{cd}}}* into the *{{{gray-matter/}}}* directory, and
  * Type: *{{{make -f CYGmakefile}}}*
The Windows executable is now: *{{{bin/gray.exe}}}*

=Install WinBoard and Gray Matter=
  * [Install Follow these steps].  Of course, instead of the provided *{{{gray.exe}}}*, use the one you just compiled.

=Hack WinBoard=
  * !WinBoard also uses Cygwin.  It's distributed with a file named *{{{cygwin1.dll}}}* which is out of date with the version we just compiled Gray Matter against.  Copy the *{{{cygwin1.dll}}}* from Cygwin's *{{{bin/}}}* directory into !WinBoard's directory.
