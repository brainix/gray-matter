  * *!BitBoard* - A data structure, an unsigned 64-bit integer, in which each bit corresponds to a square on the chess board.  A single !BitBoard can't represent the entire state of the board.  A single bit can only hold a value of 0 or 1 - enough to describe the absence or presence of a piece on a square, but not enough to describe the piece's color or type.  Therefore, we need 12 !BitBoards to represent the entire state of the board: white pawns, white knights, white bishops, white rooks, white queens, white kings, black pawns, black knights, black bishops, black rooks, black queens, and black kings.

  * *Pondering* - What the engine does when its opponent is on move.  For a more detailed description, click [Pondering here].  See *Thinking*.

  * *Principal Variation* - A series of best moves from the current position to a given depth.  The principal variation always begins with a move for the color on move.  For example, at the start of the game, the principal variation consists of white's best move, black's best response, white's best counter-response, black's best counter-counter-response, and so on.  See *Thinking*.

  * *Thinking* - What the engine does when it's on move.  When the engine thinks, it generates a principal variation.  See *Principal Variation*, *Pondering*.
