.Nd Gray Matter, a chess engine
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm xboard -fcp gray
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Gray Matter
is a chess engine; it can play a game of chess.  It isn't very strong but is a
good learning and teaching tool.  Its authors aim to write readable,
understandable, and hackable code.  It's written in C++ and employs good
object-oriented practices.  It uses some state-of-the-art techniques such as an
MTD(f) move search and rotated bitboards.
.Pp
Gray Matter doesn't have its own interface.  However, it conforms to the Chess
Engine Communication Protocol and runs under XBoard.
.Pp
Maintaining a rating of 1200 while weighing in at a svelte 3000 lines of code,
Gray Matter offers a nice bang to buck ratio.  That's probably why adoring fans
affectionately refer to it as The Little Engine that Could.
