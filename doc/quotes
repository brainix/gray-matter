I really like the simplicity.  Nice coding.  Easy to follow and understand from
the get go.  Excellent work!

Thank you very much for having created Gray Matter - I'm trying to create a
basic chess engine to communicate with XBoard, and your code provided valuable
insight!

I had no problems compiling and playing it on my Linux box.  It's awesome!

Thanks!  In fact, your implementation caught some bugs in my pseudocode for
ttables that we're now "hashing out", as it were, on our course email list.  So
thanks much!

Well done on writing your chess engine.  I have already downloaded it and
played with it a little bit - very nice.
