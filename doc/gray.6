.Nd Gray Matter, a chess engine
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm xboard -fcp gray
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Gray Matter
is a chess engine; it can play a game of chess.  It isn't very strong but is a
good learning and teaching tool.  Its authors aim to write readable,
understandable, and hackable code.  It's written in C++ and employs good
object-oriented practices.  It uses rotated bitboards, a NegaScout move search,
and a transposition table.
.Pp
Gray Matter doesn't have its own interface.  However, it conforms to the Chess
Engine Communication Protocol and runs under XBoard.
.Pp
Maintaining a rating of 1200 while weighing in at a svelte 3000 lines of code,
Gray Matter offers a nice bang to buck ratio.  That's probably why adoring fans
affectionately refer to it as The Little Engine that Could.
