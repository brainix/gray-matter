/*
 | A bitboard is a brilliant data structure based on this observation: there
 | are 64 bits in an unsigned long long integer, there are 64 squares on a chess
 | board.  See where I'm going?  A bitboard is an unsigned 64-bit integer in
 | which every bit corresponds to a square.
 |
 | A single bitboard can't represent the entire state of the board.  A single
 | bit can only hold a value of 0 or 1 - enough to describe the absence or
 | presence of a piece on a square, but not enough to describe a piece's color
 | or type.  We therefore need 12 bitboards to represent the entire state of the
 | board:
 |
 |		 white pawns		 black pawns
 |		 white knights		 black knights
 |		 white bishops		 black bishops
 |		 white rooks		 black rooks
 |		 white queens		 black queens
 |		 white kings		 black kings
 |
 | Gray Matter introduces a new data structure, a bitrow.  A bitrow is an
 | unsigned 8-bit integer which represents up to 8 adjacent squares: a row in a
 | 0 bitboard, a column in a 90 bitboard, or a diagonal in a 45 bitboard.
